FirstCoder is a learning-first coding agent. It is not trying to beat mature tools by adding another chat box. It exists to answer a more useful question:

> What actually happens inside a coding agent when it streams, calls tools, asks for permission, compacts context, and resumes a session?

It is a real runnable agent with a Textual TUI, tool calling, permissions, sessions, OpenAI-compatible providers, and a context compaction layer. The code is intentionally organized so you can read one subsystem at a time and explain it in an interview, a portfolio review, or your own study notes.

| Built for | What you get |
| --- | --- |
| Learning agent internals | A readable implementation of provider calls, tools, permissions, session replay, and context projection |
| Portfolio storytelling | A concrete project that demonstrates more than "I called an LLM API" |
| Long-session experiments | Task-boundary-triggered compaction, append-only events, and resume-friendly state |

> [!NOTE]
> FirstCoder is a learning and portfolio project. It is usable locally, but the goal is clarity and experimentation rather than replacing mature coding agents.

## Why FirstCoder

Most coding-agent demos show the surface: a prompt goes in, code changes come out. FirstCoder focuses on the machinery in between.

| Question | Where to look |
| --- | --- |
| How model responses become tool calls | `firstcoder/agent`, `firstcoder/providers` |
| How tools touch files, shell, git, and the network | `firstcoder/tools` |
| How an agent pauses before risky actions | `firstcoder/permissions` |
| How reusable workflow instructions are discovered and loaded | `firstcoder/skills` |
| How long sessions are stored, compacted, and resumed | `firstcoder/context`, `firstcoder/session` |
| How a terminal UI streams state without hiding the loop | `firstcoder/app` |
| How to evaluate a tiny coding-agent workflow locally | `benchmark/local_pytest` |

## Quickstart

Recommended install:

```sh
pipx install firstcoder
```

If you do not use `pipx`:

```sh
python -m pip install firstcoder
```

Install from source for development:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Start the TUI:

```sh
firstcoder
```

Run one message without opening the TUI:

```sh
firstcoder --message "Summarize this repository in one paragraph"
```

Use line-oriented interactive mode:

```sh
firstcoder --interactive
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
py -m pip install firstcoder
firstcoder
```

## Configuration

Create a starter config:

```sh
firstcoder config init
firstcoder config path
firstcoder config show
```

Default config locations:

```text
global:  ~/.config/firstcoder/config.toml
project: ./firstcoder.toml
```

Example:

```toml
model = "yurenapi/gpt-5.5"

[provider]
type = "openai-compatible"
name = "yurenapi"
base_url = "https://example.com/v1"
api_key_env = "FIRSTCODER_API_KEY"

[permissions]
mode = "ask"

[ui]
theme = "default"
```

Keep secrets in environment variables:

```sh
export FIRSTCODER_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

Config precedence:

```text
CLI --provider
> environment variables / .env
> project firstcoder.toml
> global ~/.config/firstcoder/config.toml
> defaults
```

## TUI

FirstCoder's TUI is designed to expose the agent loop instead of hiding it. You can see the current session, provider/model, permission mode, activity state, streamed assistant output, tool calls, tool results, and permission prompts.

Empty session:

![FirstCoder empty TUI](docs/images/tui-empty.png)

Tool calls appear in the conversation flow:

![FirstCoder tool calls](docs/images/tui-tools.png)

Permission requests pause the agent until the user decides:

![FirstCoder permission request](docs/images/tui-permission.png)

The activity line is intentionally visible. When the model is thinking, streaming, running a tool, waiting for permission, or reading tool results, the UI should make that state obvious.

## Core Experiment

**Task-boundary-triggered compaction** is the most original part of FirstCoder.

Many agents summarize or truncate history when token pressure gets high. FirstCoder also handles token pressure, but its more interesting path is semantic: when the user moves to a new task, the agent can compact old task context before it pollutes the next one.

```text
user message
  -> model calls task_boundary(decision, basis_message_id)
  -> program generates candidate task_hash
  -> stable window confirms the task switch
  -> TASK_HASH_CHANGED triggers compaction
  -> old task content is micro-compacted
  -> session events preserve the transition for resume
```

The model never invents the hash. It only submits a small structured signal:

```json
{
  "decision": "same | new | uncertain",
  "basis_message_id": "msg_xxx"
}
```

Then the program generates a stable hash from the session id, the basis message id, and the task-boundary strategy version. A stable window prevents one bad model guess from immediately switching tasks.

| Design choice | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Program-owned task hash | The model cannot invent or drift task identities |
| Stable-window confirmation | One mistaken `new` signal does not immediately compact history |
| `TASK_HASH_CHANGED` trigger | Compaction can run because the task changed, not only because tokens are high |
| Append-only events | Resume can replay task-boundary observations and active task state |

In short, FirstCoder treats compaction as a task lifecycle problem, not only a context-window emergency.

## Core Features

| Feature | What it demonstrates |
| --- | --- |
| Agent loop | Multi-round model calls, tool calls, final answers, and loop limits |
| Streaming | OpenAI-compatible 流式 text, tool-call delta assembly, and basic `reasoning_delta` forwarding |
| Tools | File reading/writing, shell, git, diagnostics, web fetch/search, todo, and user questions |
| Permissions | Local `ALLOW / ASK / DENY` decisions plus long-lived grants |
| Skills | Project and machine-level workflow discovery, routing, loading, and audit events |
| Sessions | Append-only JSONL events, catalog, resume, rename, and share/export |
| Context | Checkpoints, archives, task hashes, L1-L4 compaction, and `PROMPT_TOO_LONG` recovery |
| TUI | Markdown rendering, live activity state, tool entries, permission prompts, and slash commands |
| Evaluation | A small local pytest benchmark for checking whether the agent can solve tiny coding tasks |

## Skills

FirstCoder has a first-class skill layer for reusable workflow instructions. A skill is not just extra prose in `AGENTS.md`: it is discovered, routed, loaded before provider work, and recorded in the session log.

Supported skill sources:

| Source | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Project markdown skills | `<project-root>/skills/*.md` |
| Project agent skills | `<project-root>/.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` |
| Machine-level agent skills | `~/.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`, `~/.codex/skills/*/SKILL.md` |
| Machine-level markdown skills | `~/.firstcoder/skills/*.md` |

When a user message clearly matches a skill, FirstCoder loads that skill before the first provider request for the turn. Loaded skills can also declare required files, which are read from the same skill root and included with the loaded context.

Skill behavior is auditable through append-only session events:

```json
{"type": "skill_selected", "skill_path": "skills/example.md", "reason": "metadata_match"}
{"type": "skill_loaded", "skill_path": "skills/example.md", "content_hash": "..."}
{"type": "skill_required_file_loaded", "file_path": "docs/policy.md", "content_hash": "..."}
```

Project skills take priority over global skills. Global skills can add machine-local capabilities, but they cannot override project instructions, permission policy, or sandbox boundaries.

## Providers

The current mainline is **OpenAI Chat Completions-compatible**. That path supports normal messages, function tools, streaming text, tool-call delta assembly, and a basic `reasoning_delta` event path when compatible providers emit it.

When a provider returns `PROMPT_TOO_LONG`, FirstCoder attempts context compaction and retries the request once.

Common provider environment variables:

| Provider | API key | Model | Default model |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `OPENAI_MODEL` | `gpt-4.1-mini` |
| `deepseek` | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | `DEEPSEEK_MODEL` | `deepseek-chat` |
| `qwen` | `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` | `QWEN_MODEL` | `qwen-plus` |
| `moonshot` | `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` | `MOONSHOT_MODEL` | `moonshot-v1-8k` |
| `zhipu` | `ZHIPUAI_API_KEY` | `ZHIPU_MODEL` | `glm-4-flash` |
| `openrouter` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | `OPENROUTER_MODEL` | `openai/gpt-4.1-mini` |
| `ollama` | `OLLAMA_API_KEY` | `OLLAMA_MODEL` | `qwen2.5-coder:7b` |
| `anthropic` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-4-5` |

DeepSeek example:

```sh
export FIRSTCODER_PROVIDER="deepseek"
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export DEEPSEEK_MODEL="deepseek-chat"
```

Any OpenAI-compatible service:

```sh
export FIRSTCODER_PROVIDER="openai-compatible"
export FIRSTCODER_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export FIRSTCODER_BASE_URL="https://example.com/v1"
export FIRSTCODER_MODEL="your-model"
```

Local Ollama:

```sh
export FIRSTCODER_PROVIDER="ollama"
export OLLAMA_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434/v1"
export OLLAMA_MODEL="qwen2.5-coder:7b"
```

Anthropic support is experimental / 实验性. It does not yet cover full Anthropic 原生 thinking/cache/streaming behavior. FirstCoder also does not currently claim support for OpenAI Responses API, complete reasoning persistence/display, or multimodal / 多模态 input/output.

## Permissions

FirstCoder separates "the model wants to do this" from "the program is allowed to do this."

Permission actions include:

- `read_path`
- `write_path`
- `delete_path`
- `execute_shell`
- `network_request`
- `git_operation`
- `read_env`

Decisions:

```text
ALLOW -> execute immediately
ASK   -> pause and ask the user
DENY  -> block the action
```

Modes:

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `conservative` | More confirmations, safer defaults |
| `standard` | Balanced default |
| `aggressive` | More willing to run common project-local actions |
| `bypass` | Skip policy checks for controlled experiments |

Long-lived grants are created when the user chooses `allow_always_same_scope`. They are stored under the current data root in `permissions.json`.

## Sessions

FirstCoder stores session facts as append-only JSONL events. Checkpoints and compaction events change the effective context sent to the provider, but they do not replace the underlying event log.

Default data root:

```text
<project-root>/.firstcoder/
```

It stores:

- session event logs
- session catalog data
- context checkpoints and archives
- compaction events
- long-lived permission grants
- exported transcripts

Resume rebuilds state from the event log, including task-boundary observations and active task hash state.

```

## Local Benchmark

The lightweight local pytest benchmark lives in:

```text
benchmark/local_pytest/
```

It creates tiny Python task repositories, lets FirstCoder modify them, and grades the result with pytest. It is not a leaderboard. It is a local probe for the loop:

```text
read task -> inspect files -> edit code -> run tests -> stop
```

Run a smoke benchmark:

```sh
.venv/bin/python benchmark/local_pytest/runner.py \
  --workdir runs/local-pytest-smoke \
  --summary-out runs/local-pytest-smoke-summary.json \
  --max-tasks 1
```

See [docs/LOCAL_PYTEST_BENCHMARK.md](docs/LOCAL_PYTEST_BENCHMARK.md) for details.

## Development

Install dev dependencies:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Run all tests:

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m pytest
```

Run focused tests:

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_app_tui.py -q
```

Build a package:

```sh
python -m pip install build
python -m build
```

Test a global install locally:

```sh
pipx install --force .
firstcoder
```

Tests should avoid real API keys and network calls. Provider, tool, context, permission, session, and benchmark behavior should use fakes, fixtures, or temporary directories whenever possible.

## Roadmap

Near-term:

- Better `/help`, `/new`, and picker-style `/resume`.
- Grant listing and revocation commands.
- More polished streaming Markdown in the TUI.
- Stronger agent-loop guardrails around verification, runtime, and tool rounds.
- More benchmark coverage for local coding tasks.

Longer-term:

- Refine task-aware context compaction into a more reliable long-session memory layer.
- Deepen Anthropic protocol support, including native streaming, thinking/cache behavior, and provider-specific message semantics.
- Add long-term memory for stable project knowledge, user preferences, and reusable task context.
- Explore multi-agent orchestration for planner/executor/reviewer workflows and parallel coding tasks.
